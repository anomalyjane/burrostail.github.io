			<h1>Welcome to BTF!</h1>
			<p>In 2016, we set up shop for the very first time at our local farmers' market, bringing our creative succulent arrangements to a warm reception in the metro region. Later, we took the Burro-mobile and headed to SoWa in Boston's South End to sling plants alongside some of the finest and funkiest vendors in town. Stay tuned for info on BTF's 2017 season! We can't wait to share our love of these amazing desert plants with you!</p>

			<h1>Market Picks</h1>
			<p>It's morning, but still dark. We take in the cool air while we load the Burro-Mobile with a fresh, happy batch of succulent arrangements for market. The pots range in size from itty bitties the size of an espresso cup all the way up to teapots, soup bowls, and antique flour sifters. We've searched high and low to find an interesting array of upcycled containers, carefully selected just the right combination of plants for each one, and tucked the plants snugly into their new digs. Now the time has come! We survey our crates full of green treasure... It's market day.</p>
