		<h1>Shaking Off the Winter Slumber</h1>
		<div class="timeStamp">May 8th, 2017</div>
		<p>It's May, and the spring-flowering trees are starting to shed their blooms. Bees are out and about. Sweaters have been consigned once again to the attic with that certain type of relief and gratitude that sun-starved New Englanders feel at the end of a long, gray, dismal winter. Two weeks ago we had been feeling so optimistic about the weather that we brought all of the succulents out into the light of day for the season.</p>
		<p>And yet... with temps tonight forecast to dip into the 30s (the 30s!), this afternoon we found ourselves dragging every last plant back into the garage, where hopefully they will stay safe from the cold. Although it's challenging to find any hard data about what temperatures various succulents can tolerate, a general rule of thumb I try to follow is not to leave them outside when the temps are going to dip below 45 degrees F. The only exceptions I make are creeping stonecrops--such as Sedum rupestre, which can be planted directly in the ground in fall, where they easily weather a Boston winter with their leaves intact--and a couple of types of crassula (such as hylotelephium), which die back in the winter but return as perennials early in the spring.</p>

			<h1>Interview: Spike E. Succulent</h1>
			<div class="timeStamp">April 15th, 2017</div>
				<p>We sat down with Spike to talk about art, philosophy, and the good life, from a succulent's point of view.</p>
				<p><b>What's up, man? How are you?</b><br>
					Good, good--things are good these days.</p>
				<p><b>So, tell us a little about your latest work.</b><br>
					Sure! Lately I've been sitting right by the window everyday--it's, well, it's meditative. I focus on just absorbing the energy coming to me--I think that's the real work of an artist. In my case, it's in the form of sunlight, you know, so it's all about the chlorophyll I create and how that substance interacts with the energy around me.</p>
				<p><b>Seems so relateable, even to me as a human.</b><br>
					Yeah, I mean, I believe that plantlife and humans have the potential for shared notions of art. I just don't believe that our living alongside each other could be merely utilitarian.</p>
				<p><b>As a succulent, do you ever feel misunderstood?</b><br>
					Oh, certainly. They're stacking young succulents in with the tropicals in big box stores all over the place. And without a drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. Get out of here with that nonsense! I'm a desert plant with desert plant needs. Don't throw me shade! [Laughs]. I need bright light for a good part of the day, as in my native habitat. Give me that and you've given me everything. I can do my life's work.</p>
